Explanation:

Your Browser: You enter the URL https://www.google.com in the address bar and press Enter.
DNS Resolution: The browser doesn't understand domain names, so it sends a request to a DNS resolver to translate the domain name (www.google.com) into its corresponding IP address (e.g., 142.250.184.196).
Firewall: The request goes through a firewall, a security system that filters incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules.
Load Balancer: The request reaches the load balancer, a device that distributes traffic across multiple web servers to ensure optimal performance and prevent overloading any single server.
Web Server: The load balancer directs the request to a web server. The web server is responsible for serving static content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up the basic structure of the webpage.
Application Server: The web server might delegate generating dynamic content (like search results on Google) to an application server. The application server retrieves data from the database.
Database: The application server interacts with the database to fetch the necessary information to generate the webpage.
Response: The application server sends the generated webpage content back to the web server.
Web Server: The web server receives the content and prepares a response to send back to your browser. 1 Encryption (HTTPS): It's important to note that in a secure connection (HTTPS), the communication between your browser and the web server is encrypted using protocols like TLS/SSL. This encryption protects your data from being intercepted by third parties.
Your Browser: Your browser receives the response from the web server, interprets the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, and displays the webpage on your screen.
